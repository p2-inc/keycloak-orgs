## Overview
This document outlines the functionality and usage of the new Bulk Roles Grant/Revoke feature in the REST resources API.
The feature facilitates the efficient assignment and removal of roles for both organizations and users within those organizations.

## Endpoints
4 new endpoints were added.

Bulk operations process each submitted record independently, allowing failures to be caught but the remainder of the import to succeed. 
Each bulk operation response provides the success or failure status for each record for processing:
```
HTTP/1.1 207 Multi-Status
Content-Type: application/json

[
    { "status": 201, error: null, item: {} },
    { "status": 201, error: null, item: {} },
    { "status": 400, error: "HTTP 409 Conflict", item: {} },
]
```
In this design, we return the result of each record individually by returning the 207 Multi-Status response.
